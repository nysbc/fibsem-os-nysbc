"""Declarative canvas-state model for the quad-view microscope display.

Pure data: one :class:`CanvasState` per canvas (image + overlays + info + the
armed overlay), aggregated by :class:`SceneModel`. Producers mutate this model
*only* through ``MicroscopeViewController`` (the reducer), which renders it onto
the matplotlib canvases in a single debounced pass.

Overlay specs (:class:`OverlaySpec` subclasses) are data records the reducer maps
onto the existing ``CanvasOverlay`` objects — they hold no Qt / matplotlib state,
so they stay trivially testable and thread-safe to construct.

Each spec is keyed on a canvas by its ``id``, so re-setting a spec with the same id
updates that overlay in place rather than stacking a second one.
