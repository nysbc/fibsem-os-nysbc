"""AutoLamella's short names for the AUTOLAMELLA_* paths in fibsem.config.

Assignments rather than `from fibsem.config import AUTOLAMELLA_X as X`. The two
are equivalent at runtime, but an aliased import means "deliberate re-export" to
a reader and "unused import" to every tool: ruff rates deleting these as a *safe*
fix, which empties this module and takes `import ...autolamella.structures` down
with it. Its isort rule also splits a multi-alias import into one statement per
name, which is how six constants came to occupy eighteen lines. Assignment says
the same thing unambiguously to both audiences.
