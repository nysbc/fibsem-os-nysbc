# Documentation for a human reading a file, not a parsing switch -- from_dict does not
# branch on it, and additive changes are detected from field presence instead (FIB-445
# D3). Bumped to v4 when FibsemExperimentRef gained `name` and `id` became the UUID;
# to v5 when it dropped its duplicates of the application/version fields, which
# SystemInfo owns, and when `application_version` went entirely -- it was null in every
# file ever written (FIB-448). Those keys are still present in v4-and-earlier files.
# v6 replaced the embedded `system` (a whole SystemSettings, 1683 bytes) with
# `system_info` and `hardware_geometry` (FIB-481). from_dict recovers both from a v5-
# and-earlier `system` blob, so older files still load -- including their compustage
# flag, which up to v5 had to be inferred from the model name.
# v7 dropped `autogamma` from the recorded image settings along with the feature
# itself (FIB-505). Older files still carry the key; it is ignored.
# v8 added `workflow` -- which item and which task an image was acquired for
# (FIB-466). Absent in earlier files, and absent in any image acquired outside a
# workflow, which is a real answer rather than a missing one.
